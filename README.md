# The Things
An easy way to save some things.

# You made it!
Holy crap ðŸ’©! You found the GitHub page!! If you don't know where you are ("What is this GitHub thing??") then just download the Things on the App Store (coming soon). If you are here on purpose, or absolutely love GitHub... or are interested in helping out, send me an email or message and lets chat!

# Ask for beta testing!
If you are interested in providing feedback for beta testing new versions of the Things, please reach out! 

# Build In Xcode
In order to build the app in Xcode:
  1. Make sure you're signed in with your developer account in order to sign the binary and install it on a device.
  2. Run pod install in the project directory.
